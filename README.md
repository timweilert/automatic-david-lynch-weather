Good morning!

It's today, this year and it's the day of the week that it is now.

Here in your zip code it's your own personal David Lynch Daily Weather Report

It's very calm, very still right now...

This afternoon, to call the script, provide a key from weatherapi.com in a file called key.rb

This script takes 1 argument for zip code, so usage is as follows:

$ruby weather.rb 90210

Enjoy those blue skies and golden sunshine all along the way.

Everyone, have a great day!
